# IOT-Air-Pollution-detection
IOT Based Air Pollution Monitoring System is used to monitor the Air Quality over a web server using Internet. It will trigger an alarm when the air quality goes down beyond a certain level, means when there are sufficient amount of harmful gases present in the air like CO2, smoke, alcohol, benzene, NH3 and NOx.

Sensor gives a value of 90 when there is no gas near it and the safe level of air quality is 350 PPM and it should not exceed 1000 PPM. When it exceeds the limit of 1000 PPM, then it starts causing Headaches, sleepiness and stagnant, stale, stuffy air and if exceeds beyond 2000 PPM then it can cause increased heart rate and many other diseases.

When the value will be less than 1000 PPM, then the LCD and webpage will display “Fresh Air”.  Whenever the value will increase 1000 PPM, then the buzzer will start beeping and the LCD and webpage will display “Poor Air, Open Windows”. If it will increase 2000 then the buzzer will keep beeping and the LCD and webpage will display “Danger! Move to fresh Air”.
